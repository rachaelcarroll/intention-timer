## Overview
Intention Timer is an application which allows users to track and manage activities. `Study`, `Meditate`, and `Exercise` are three categories a user may choose to help organize their goals. User can input a desired length of time and use the built in countdown timer to do the work for them! User can leave the application and return without losing their previous logged activities.
